                            <p>Since its establishment in 1984, the Alameda County Vector Control Services District has continued its mission of protecting the nearly 1.3 million residents of Alameda County from vector-borne diseases. By controlling vectors, eliminating causal environmental factors, and educating the public, Vector Control seeks to prevent vector-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, West Nile Virus, and Zika, from entering and spreading in Alameda County.</p>

                            <p>Alameda County Vector Control has generously provided us with mosquito traps and sends collected mosquito eggs to UC Davis for analysis.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Joyce Blueford, founder and president of Math Science Nucleus, has dedicated much of her life to science. As a geologist, she studied the evolution of sedimentary basins in the Pacific Ocean, California, Alaska, and Russia. In her time as a U.S. Geological Survey research scientist, Dr. Blueford became a strong proponent of involving more women and minorities in the ranks of geologists. She also became an advocate of strengthening science education, authoring 23 science books for children, as well as the Integrating Science, Math, and Technology Reference curriculum, which is used in school districts across the country. Dr. Blueford continues her efforts to foster a love for science in young people, involving students in research and educational projects.</p>
